# Classification_with_keras
Building classification model for classical handwritten letter problem, with Keras library 

In this lab, we will learn how to use the Keras library to build models for classificaiton problems. We will use the popular MNIST dataset, a dataset of images, for a change.

The MNIST database, short for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits written by high school students and employees of the United States Census Bureau.

Also, this way, will get to compare how conventional neural networks compare to convolutional neural networks, that we will build in the next module.

1. Use of MNIST database for training various image processing systemsÂ¶
2. Build a Neural Network 
3. Train and Test the Network.
